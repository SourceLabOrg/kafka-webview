## 2.4.0 (07/02/2019)
#### New Features

- [ISSUE-184](https://github.com/SourceLabOrg/kafka-webview/issues/184) Cluster Kafka Consumer View for multiple topics.

#### Bug Fixes

## 2.3.0 (06/19/2019)
#### New Features
- [ISSUE-166](https://github.com/SourceLabOrg/kafka-webview/issues/166) Add groupSearchFilter property to specify the filter used to list LDAP group membership. Thanks for the contribution @[BlueIcarus](https://github.com/BlueIcarus)!
- [MultiThreaded Consumer](https://github.com/SourceLabOrg/kafka-webview/pull/170) Add multi-threaded kafka consumer.  

Previously a single consumer instance was used when paging through messages from a topic.  Each partition was consumed sequentially in order to provide consistent results on each page.  For topics with a large number of partitions this could take considerable time.

The underlying consumer implementation has been replaced with a multi-threaded version which will attempt to read each partition in parallel.  The following configuration properties have been added to control this behavior:

```yml
app:
  ## Enable multi-threaded consumer support
  ## The previous single-threaded implementation is still available by setting this property to false.
  ## The previous implementation along with this property will be removed in future release.
  multiThreadedConsumer: true

  ## Sets upper limit on the number of concurrent consumers (non-websocket) supported.
  maxConcurrentWebConsumers: 32
```

If you run into issues, you can disable the new implementation and revert to the previous behavior by setting the `multiThreadedConsumer` property to `false`.

- [ISSUE-160](https://github.com/SourceLabOrg/kafka-webview/issues/160) Fix startup scripts for Windows environment.  Thanks for the contribution @[quentingodeau](https://github.com/quentingodeau)!
